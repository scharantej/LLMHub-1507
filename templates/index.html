<h1>What are Large Language Models (LLMs)?</h1>
<p>LLMs are a type of machine learning model that is trained on a massive dataset of text and code. This training allows them to understand and generate natural language, perform complex tasks like translation and summarization, and even write creative content.</p>
<h2>Benefits of LLMs</h2>
<ul>
<li>Improved Natural Language Processing (NLP)</li>
<li>Enhanced Machine Translation</li>
<li>Efficient Text Summarization</li>
<li>Code Generation and Analysis</li>
</ul>
